# FastMonitor

**FastMonitor** is a C# .NET data access package designed to enforce zero trust security principles. This package verifies user authorization for each data request, ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive information. FastMonitor also logs all access attempts, providing comprehensive auditing for security and compliance purposes.

## Key Features

- **Zero Trust Authorization**: Verifies user permissions on each request to ensure secure data access.
- **Auditing and Logging**: Tracks and logs all access attempts for data transparency and accountability.
- **Sensitive Data Protection**: Configurable access policies to restrict data access based on roles, permissions, and contextual information.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the FastMonitor package via NuGet Package Manager Console:

```bash
Install-Package FastMonitor
```

Or, add it to your .csproj file:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="FastMonitor" Version="1.0.0" />
```

## Setup and Configuration
FastMonitor requires minimal setup. Start by configuring the package with the desired access policies and logging levels.

Initialize FastMonitor in your applicationâ€™s startup file (e.g., Startup.cs).
Configure role-based access restrictions and logging preferences.

```csharp
// Example of setting up FastMonitor in a .NET application
using FastMonitor;

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddFastMonitor(options =>
        {
            options.RequireRoleBasedAccess = true;
            options.LogAllAccessAttempts = true;
        });
    }
}
```

## Usage
FastMonitor integrates with your data access layer to enforce authorization and logging automatically.


```csharp
using FastMonitor;

public class SensitiveDataService
{
    private readonly IFastMonitor _fastMonitor;

    public SensitiveDataService(IFastMonitor fastMonitor)
    {
        _fastMonitor = fastMonitor;
    }

    public async Task<Data> GetSensitiveData(int dataId, User user)
    {
        var isAuthorized = _fastMonitor.CheckAccess(user, dataId);
        if (!isAuthorized)
        {
            throw new UnauthorizedAccessException("Access Denied: Insufficient permissions.");
        }

        _fastMonitor.LogAccessAttempt(user, dataId);
        return await FetchData(dataId);
    }
}
```
## Example Scenarios
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define specific roles with access permissions to data resources.
Access Logging: Track who accessed what data and when, aiding in compliance and incident response.
Unauthorized Access Prevention: Prevent unauthorized users from viewing sensitive data with enforced zero trust checks.
